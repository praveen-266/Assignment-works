# Assignment: Text Classification using Hugging Face

### Objective: The goal of this assignment is to build a text classification model using the Hugging Face library to classify a dataset of text into one of multiple categories. The candidate will use a pre-trained model such as BERT or GPT-2 as a starting point and fine-tune it on the classification task.

### Instructions:                
* Choose a dataset of text that has multiple categories (e.g. news articles labeled as sports, politics, entertainment, etc.). The dataset should have at least 1000 samples for each category.

* Preprocess the text data by cleaning it, removing stopwords, punctuations and other irrelevant characters.

* Use the Hugging Face library to fine-tune a pre-trained model such as BERT or GPT-2 on the classification task. The candidate should use the transformers library in python.

* Train the model on the dataset and evaluate the performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.

* Use the trained model to predict the categories of a few samples from the test set.

**Write a report that includes the following:**

* A brief introduction to the task and the dataset used                          
* The preprocessing steps taken                      
* The architecture of the model used, and how it was fine-tuned                     
* The evaluation metrics and the results obtained                     
* A discussion of the performance of the model and possible ways to improve it.                  
* Sample predictions and their explanations                  
* Submit the report, the code and the dataset used for the task.             

**Notes:**               

Use the latest version of transformers and python.
