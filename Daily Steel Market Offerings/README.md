### DATASET :
The attached dataset “daily_offers.xlsx” is a representation of steel items offered to customers. Each row represents an item, and has an offered/selling price of that item.

#### You as the Data Scientist is tasked to :           
•	Analyze all the features, using statistical and visualization methods of your choice and prepare the data for a regression model. (You may demonstrate your creativity and skills here by involving techniques like data summarization, correlation, data cleaning, feature engineering, etc.)                                    
•	Split the data into training and testing sets in the ratio of 90:10 respectively. Build multiple regression models to predict the price of an item (At least 4 models).
                                                                
•	Hyperparameter tune the best regression model.                        
•	Evaluate the best model using the metric r2 score on the testing set.                       

**INSTRUCTIONS :**       

•	The programming must be done on Jupyter Notebook using Python language. (IDEs such as VSCode may be used to boost productivity.)                         
•	Google Colab is also allowed for the coding but ensure to download it as a .ipynb file for submission.                          
•	Taking references from the internet is accepted but the candidate must ensure that they understand the concept. They may be asked questions regarding the code.         
•	A thoughtful, clean & commented code is expected during submission.                         
•	Please do not upload the submission in any public sites such as GitHub. Doing so immediately disqualifies the candidate.             


Finally, you are required to create a detailed report to document your work where you may showcase your analysis, visualizations, results, findings, etc.
